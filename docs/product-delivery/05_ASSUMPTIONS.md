# STAR Assumptions and Working Hypotheses

**Version:** v0.1.3  
**Status:** Not confirmed architecture

| ID | Hypothesis | Confidence | Validation required |
|---|---|---:|---|
| ASM-001 | STAR's first practical foundation should be capability-oriented rather than tool-oriented. | Medium-high | Map one end-to-end Mission and show that capabilities remain stable while tools vary. |
| ASM-002 | A useful delivery loop may be expressed as need/value → Mission → work → release/operation → evidence/learning. | Medium-high | Desk-tested on SmartQuote and GateHub; populate a real active Mission and inspect missing states. |
| ASM-003 | Mission is likely the primary cross-functional delivery container. | Medium-high | Candidate definition and counterexamples exist; validate size, hierarchy and closure on real work. |
| ASM-004 | Work-centric views may be more useful than purely role-centric dashboards. | Medium | Conduct role walkthroughs; test people performing multiple work types. |
| ASM-005 | AI quality will depend heavily on current, authorized and relationship-aware context. | High | Prototype one AI development or analysis task using a structured context package and compare results. |
| ASM-006 | Stable IDs and explicit relationships can provide most early traceability without a dedicated graph database. | Medium-high | Implement links in Markdown/YAML for one Mission and measure retrieval quality. |
| ASM-007 | Progressive disclosure can reduce learning cost while preserving deep traceability. | High | Usability-test executive, PM, developer, QA, Ops and customer views. |
| ASM-008 | `STARSAAS/star-architecture` is the likely GitHub home for this foundation. | Confirmed | Resolved by `DEC-0032` on 2026-07-12. |
| ASM-009 | A generic Decision Record may cover product, business, architecture and governance decisions with a Type field. | Medium-high | `templates/DECISION_RECORD.md` now exists; test it on three different decision types before creating specialized templates. |
| ASM-010 | STAR should eventually dogfood its own change, review, release and learning mechanisms. | Medium-high | Branch, Draft PR, changelog and reviewable Markdown are in use; complete review/merge and record friction. |
| ASM-011 | A one-page Mission Brief can become the primary team-facing view while authoritative detail remains linked. | Medium-high | Use `templates/MISSION_BRIEF.md` with a real Mission and measure comprehension and duplication. |
| ASM-012 | A small responsibility card can be clearer than a full RACI matrix for the first Mission view. | Medium | Compare the card with an actual cross-functional responsibility review and add detail only where ambiguity remains. |
| ASM-013 | One authoritative source per information class will reduce contradiction better than placing all enterprise information in GitHub. | High | Map actual STAR tools and test cross-links, access and update latency. |
| ASM-014 | Candidate → Confirmed → Frozen/Superseded → Archived is sufficient as the first knowledge lifecycle. | Medium | Apply the lifecycle, owner and review trigger to existing Product Delivery files and inspect edge cases. |

## Rule

An assumption becomes a decision only after evidence, review and explicit acceptance. It is moved by adding a new Decision ID; this file retains the historical assumption and its outcome.
