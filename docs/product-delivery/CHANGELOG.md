# Changelog

All notable changes to this Markdown baseline are recorded here.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- Established the authoritative `missions/M001/` record set for `Mission-001 · SmartQuote Foundation`:
  - `README.md`;
  - `MISSION_BRIEF.md`;
  - `DECISION_LOG.md`;
  - `WORK_STATUS.md`;
  - `WALKTHROUGH_PREPARATION.md`.

### Confirmed

- Robin is the Mission Owner.
- Jason Lin is the Product / Service Owner.
- The proposed first-stage scope and exclusions are approved.
- The first acceptance outcome is the end-to-end internal quotation scenario from Merchant through API Query.
- M0-M4 milestone gates are approved.
- Draft PR #1 on `agent/star-os-product-delivery-baseline` is the authoritative working location.

### Changed

- M001 moved from `Intake` to `Candidate — Baseline Confirmed`.
- V1 moved from blocked by a missing Mission baseline to ready to schedule; it has not passed.
- V2 remains blocked until V1 passes and leadership explicitly marks M001 Committed.
- README, Manifest, Active Mission Intake, Validation Plan, Work Status and GitHub Sync Status now link the M001 record set.
- Unsupported historical completion or freeze claims are classified as `Unverified / Not authoritative`; they are not `Superseded` without an explicit authoritative supersession record.

### Still missing

- Named business acceptance representative.
- Named Product, Architecture, Backend, Frontend, QA, DevOps/Operations and business walkthrough representatives.
- Calendar dates for M1-M4.
- Verified dependency readiness and implementation evidence.

### Boundary

- SmartQuote Delivery has not started.
- M001 is not Committed.
- No formal implementation, complete backlog or finalized API/database/architecture design has been authorized.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-13

### Completed

- Finished the 40-file repository alignment across README, Manifest, Validation Plan, Work Status, Sync Status and Draft PR #1.
- Completed the design-level A3 high-impact AI dry run without production, customer, secret or sensitive-data action.
- Completed the final file/status consistency check for this work batch.

### Current evidence gates

- V1/V2/V4 require one authoritative active Mission and representative participants.
- V5 still requires one authorized code/test task and one bounded non-document sandbox action.
- V6 requires STAR's actual enterprise system and owner map.
- V3 retains a prospective contested-decision limitation.

### GitHub status

- Draft PR #1 remains open, reviewable and unmerged.
- No GitHub action is currently required from the user.
- Further abstract documents should not be added merely to create volume while the evidence gates remain blocked.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- `20_ROLE_VIEW_DESK_WALKTHROUGH.md` with a cross-functional orientation test.
- `21_AI_CONTEXT_PACKAGE_TEST.md` and reusable AI context templates.
- `22_KNOWLEDGE_METADATA_AUDIT.md`, `23_KNOWLEDGE_REVIEW_REGISTER.md` and `templates/KNOWLEDGE_METADATA.md`.
- `24_AI_A3_HIGH_IMPACT_DRY_RUN.md` for a design-level production/customer-impact control test.
- `templates/ACTIVE_MISSION_INTAKE.md`, `templates/AI_CONTEXT_PACKAGE.md` and `templates/AI_TASK_CONTEXT.md`.

### Hardened

- Added owner, maintainer, review trigger, authoritative-source, impact, supersession and access metadata to the highest-impact foundation files.
- Established a central review register so durable knowledge does not remain silently unowned or stale.
- Aligned README and Manifest with the complete 40-file Draft PR set.

### Validated

- Why / What / Who / Now / Evidence remains sufficient for role orientation in a desk walkthrough, but real participant execution is still unproven.
- A bounded AI context package was sufficient for A2 reversible documentation/GitHub work.
- The A3 design dry run preserved human approval, rollback, observation, customer-communication and stop boundaries without executing a real action.

### Still blocked

- V1/V2 require one authoritative active Mission with real owners, scope, dates, dependencies, approvals and evidence.
- V4 requires representative participants using the real Mission Brief.
- V5 still requires AI code/test evidence and a bounded non-document sandbox action.
- V6 requires the actual STAR enterprise system and owner map.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Three cross-domain Decision Record examples for `DEC-0030`, `DEC-0032` and `DEC-0034`.
- `18_DECISION_RECORD_VALIDATION.md` with the V3 generic-template result.
- `19_AI_WORK_CONTROL_DRY_RUN.md` with the V5 A1/A2 governance result.

### Validated

- One generic Decision Record remained usable across Product/Delivery, Architecture/Repository and Governance/Working Method decisions.
- Specialized ADR/PDR/GDR templates are not justified yet; a prospective contested decision remains the next test.
- The current GitHub documentation batch met A2 reversible-execution controls: bounded scope, dedicated branch, Draft PR, traceability, no merge and retained human authority.

### Updated

- Marked V3 complete with a retrospective limitation.
- Marked V5 partial; code/test work, another sandbox execution and A3 high-impact dry-run remain open.
- Updated README, Manifest, Open Questions and Work Status with the new evidence.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Recorded `DEC-0034`: list planned tasks before a multi-step batch, then execute and report them step by step.
- Added the same work-batch communication rule to `07_WORKING_METHOD.md`.

### Updated

- Marked V0 Active Mission intake audit complete.
- Marked V1 and V2 blocked by the absence of an authoritative real-Mission baseline.
- Marked V6 blocked until STAR's actual enterprise tool/source map is recorded.
- Updated `17_WORK_STATUS.md` with completed audit work and the next executable validation batch.
- Updated the Draft PR description and GitHub synchronization status to match the current baseline.

### Verified

- README, Manifest, Changelog, Sync Status and PR contents are aligned.
- Current candidate documents do not conflict with confirmed Decision Log constraints.
- No user GitHub action is required; Draft PR #1 remains open and should not yet be merged.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- `16_ACTIVE_MISSION_INTAKE.md` with the current evidence-gap audit for Mission-001 and Mission-002.
- `17_WORK_STATUS.md` with current tasks, progress, blockers, next actions and user-decision status.

### Verified

- `STARSAAS/star-platform` and `STARSAAS/star-domains` currently contain no repository material that can serve as an authoritative real-Mission baseline.
- The SmartQuote discount-rule and GateHub PSP-connector files remain desk examples, not completed real-Mission validation.

### Corrected

- Aligned README and Manifest with the actual Draft PR file set.
- Added the active-Mission intake and work-status files to the repository reading order and index.
- Clarified that no user GitHub action is currently required and Draft PR #1 should not yet be merged.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Recorded `DEC-0033`: STAR work must include timely, concise progress feedback while tasks are underway.

### Improved

- Progress feedback now has an explicit minimum shape: current task, purpose, status, next action, blocker if any, and whether a user decision is needed.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- `13_INFORMATION_AND_KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE.md` with a candidate authoritative-source map and knowledge lifecycle.
- `14_AI_WORK_GOVERNANCE.md` with candidate AI work levels, human accountability and stop conditions.
- `15_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` defining the evidence required before freeze.
- `templates/DECISION_RECORD.md` as a generic cross-domain Decision Record candidate.
- Two concise Mission Brief examples for SmartQuote discount rules and a GateHub PSP connector.

### Improved

- Added role-based reading guidance so front-line teams do not need to read the research repository.
- Made the Mission Brief the primary team-facing artifact while keeping detailed evidence linked.
- Replaced abstract open questions with concrete candidate artifacts and validation actions.
- Kept the foundation in Draft status; no candidate rule was promoted to a confirmed or frozen standard.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- One-page `11_FOUNDATION_CANDIDATE.md` with the minimum delivery loop, Mission definition, entry/exit boundaries and minimum information objects.
- `12_RESPONSIBILITY_AND_ROLE_VIEWS.md` to separate value receiver, stakeholder, owner, approver, reviewer, operator, AI agent and system responsibilities.
- `templates/MISSION_BRIEF.md` as the first team-facing template for real-Mission validation.

### Changed

- Made the one-page foundation and Mission Brief the primary README entry points.
- Linked open questions and assumptions to concrete validation artifacts instead of leaving them as abstract research topics.
- Replaced the stale manually maintained SHA-256 table with Git-based integrity guidance and a live file index.

### Still open

- The candidate model is not frozen until it is used on a real active Mission with actual owners, dates, dependencies, approvals and outcome evidence.
- Final STAR scope/name, Mission hierarchy, AI authority boundaries and authoritative-source mapping remain open.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-12

### Changed

- Confirmed `STARSAAS/star-architecture` as the repository for this baseline.
- Set the target path to `docs/product-delivery/`.
- Published the baseline on branch `agent/star-os-product-delivery-baseline` and opened Draft PR #1.
- Clarified that GitHub storage does not freeze or approve the working baseline.
- Recorded repository/path confirmation as `DEC-0032` and resolved `OQ-006` / `ASM-008`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Initial delivery-model validation using a SmartQuote merchant discount rule and a GateHub PSP connector.
- Candidate minimum information model and role-specific Mission view.

### Learned

- Need/value → Mission → work → release → learning is a useful backbone, but ownership, decision, risk/approval, traceability and current state must cross the full lifecycle.
- Team-facing views should start with why, what, who, now and evidence; deep architecture and research should be drill-down content.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Project Charter
- Consolidated Decision Log with 31 working decisions
- Open Questions register
- Source-reviewed Research Canon candidate
- Superseded and rejected ideas register
- Assumptions register
- Cross-functional Stakeholder Map
- Working Method and quality checks
- Audit of the three early Product Delivery drafts
- Working Glossary
- Explicit GitHub synchronization status

### Corrected

- Reclassified early documents labelled v1.0 as draft v0.1 concepts pending proper validation.
- Replaced premature "fully adopt" language with contextual minimum-adoption candidates.
- Separated confirmed decisions from hypotheses and open questions.

### Known limitations at this version

- GitHub repository destination had not yet been confirmed.
- Files had not been pushed to GitHub.
- Several previously discussed frameworks still required primary-source audit.
- Final STAR scope, Mission definition and minimal meta-model remained open.
